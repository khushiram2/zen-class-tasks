Differences between http1.1 and http 2 are as follows
1) http1.1 is slower than http2 because http1.1 loads data one after another on the other hand http2 uses one tcp connection and divide
the data in multiple streams so when in http1.1 if one data got blocked all the others will be blocked which inturn slows the process of
loading where as http 2 has no such problem

2) To speed up the transfer of data both http1.1 and http2 compress the data in http packets but http 2 uses more advacnce compression
known as HPACK which is a few bytes smaller than http1.1 header packs. although these few bytes are not much singularly but when we consider
how many of these packets are used just to load one web page. these few bytes add up to much more bigger data which http2 doesn't have to send 
so it is faster

3) http 2 offers something called as weighted priortisation. this is different from http1.1 where there was no such thing and client just used
to send a req to the server and server used to respond according to the request resources asked by client and in the same order but in http2 
because there is a division of request in multiple streams so develpoers can decide which request of resources to priortise first.




objects and it's representation in java script
objects comes under composite data types and they are together there with arrays. where primitive data type can only store one value object can
store multiple values in a key:value pair and these pairs should be inside {} 
representation of object is very similar 
var obj = movie{
 Name:xyz,
releaseYear:20**'
geners:["romance","action","sci_fi"],
}
if you want to add a key:value pair you have to do this

objectname.key=value 

example => movie.ranking=4

now there will be new key:value pair added in your object 
there are a few things to keep in mind that you should take care off spellings and case i.e. uppercase or lower case because same method
is used to update a value of certain key

example=> we added a new key:value pair above which was ranking and i want to update it's value then i'll have to do this
movie.ranking=14  but if i write movie.Ranking=15 then new key:value pair will be added in the object

for deleting you have to use 

delete objectname.key

example=> delete movie.releaseYear 
now releaseYear key will be deleted from object with it's value
